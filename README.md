# virtual-memory-simulator

Implementing a Virtual Machine (VM) Simulator which will simulate the operation of a virtual
memory system. To launch the system, this simulator will accept one optional command-line
argument for the selection of the page replacement algorithm. The system will then accept
commands to read/write from/to a virtual address space. This system will correctly move
pages between disk and main memory in order to satisfy access requests and also system
properly maintain the page table as part of this process.
